In this example, you can see a simple code that implements Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and applies it to a text classification task.

The data set it uses is IMDB dataset pre-loaded on Keras. 

This is what each file does:

model.py  -->  implements the model

main.py --> shows how to load the dataset and then train the model on it

---------------------
The codes are written in Tensorflow.
